# Triplan Capstone Project

## Overview

This is the capstone project for udacity, the point of the project is to showcase my skills as a front-end developer taught in the class.

## Motivation

Allow a user to use our user interface to plan a trip to a location of their choice. During this we will provide information to help them better prepare for their trip at hand.

## How do we do this?

We are going to do it by creating a wepage that will use a form to get trip information from a user. We will then take that information from the user and use api services to gather weather
data so that user will know the temputure of their location apon arrival.
